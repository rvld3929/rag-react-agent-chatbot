# RAG Chatbot using ReAct Agent

This project demonstrates the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using the ReAct Agent framework. The chatbot combines retrieval-based and generative techniques to deliver intelligent, context-aware responses. It utilizes **OpenAI API** for natural language understanding, **LangChain** for conversational workflows, and **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.
